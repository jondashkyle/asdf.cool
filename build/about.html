        <h2>ASDF.cool is &not;</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>A simple way to manage your bookmarks.</li>
          <li>All about displaying your links how you prefer through simple design options.</li>
          <li>A personal tool I decided to make available. I use it to link to sites I frequently visit in lieu of the favorites bar in my browser. I don't like all that extra browser chrome visible, and like looking at nice type, so, why not.</li>
          <li>Better suited to desktop, altho there is nothing keeping you from using mobile.</li>
          <li>Version 1.0 â€” but there probably won't be any big feature additions. maybe some tags and live filter querying quicksilver style.</li>
          <li>If you're looking for more functionality scope <a href="http://pinboard.in" target="_blank">Pinboard</a>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Design options &not;</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Font</strong> can be set to any font locally installed on your machine. Default is Bau Medium as a webfont.</li>
          <li><strong>Columns</strong> toggles the display of your links in columns.</li>
          <li><strong>Column width</strong> adjusts the min size of your columns. These are fluid.</li>
          <li><strong>Make it day/night</strong> sets the tone of the page. If you really want the ability for custom colors or w/e feel free to request but it wasn't a priority.</li>
          <li><strong>Type size</strong> defines the size of your links.</li>
          <li><strong>Margin size</strong> adjusts the space between each of your links. This value is a multpile of the type size, so everything stays in proportion as you finesse.</li>
          <li><strong>Import/export</strong> enables you to transfer and backup your links. Because everything is stored as an object in a local DB it isn't possible to sync, but this is sort of handy. Local storage can also be a little finnicky, so I suggest exporting if you have a bunch of links added.</li>
          <li><strong>Reset links</strong> dumps your shit.</li>
          <li><strong>About</strong> brought you here. Hello.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Your data is &not;</h2>

          <li>Not syncable between machines.</li>
          <li>Exportable/importable through the Settings panel.</li>
