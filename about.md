- A way of managing bookmarks—mostly blogs, mags, news, etc…

- After clicking a link it's hidden for a while. Kind of helping to keep your FOMO in check. You can set how long the cycle lasts for each link.

- Lots of control over the design. Choose the font, type size and mood. You can arrange the links in columns, and you can adjust the width of them. Rearrange links by dragging and dropping.

- Made in a week during some free time.

## Your data

- All your links are stored in local storage, so, you own it.
- This is good because load times are essentially instant.
- It's sort of frustrating as you can't sync across machines.
- If your localstorage gets reset all your stuff is gone.
- You can back things up by importing/exporting. Probably smart to do that if you add a bunch of stuff.
- No profiles or sharing or whatever.

## Flexing

- Heavily relies on CSS stuff. REM, flexbox, native drag and drop, etc… Prob won't look too hot in older browsers.
- No frameworks here. All Browserify. Bunch of tiny modules.
- Feel free to take a look at the source in the repo.

## Pro tips

- You can set the font to anything you have installed locally. Just check to see what it's called via Fontbook or w/e.
- CTRL+N to make a new link. CTRL+S for settings.
